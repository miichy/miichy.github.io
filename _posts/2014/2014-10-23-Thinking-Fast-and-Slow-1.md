* 年初的时候就有人推荐过这本书了，却一直没有看，一直丢在kindle里。最近在听teahour时，有提及到该书，决定还是将此书翻阅以下。

## 两个系统

- 系统一：自动化到运作，非常快，不费力或少费力，不受自主控制
- 系统二：动用到注意力区做费力到心智活动，包括复杂到计算。跟代理人、选择和专注力的主观经验有关。

系统一的自动运作产生出复杂的构想模式，但是只有慢一点的系统二可以一步一步的建构思想。

- 相同
	-- 两者都需要注意力，当注意力转移时，他们当运作都会受到干扰。

注意力就像预算，你可以分配你有限都预算，但是超出预算，就会失败。

完全聚焦在一件事上，会是这个人暂时性都实名，甚至对平常会吸引他注意力对刺激毫无感觉。

**我们会对显而易见的东西看不见，而且我们看不见自己的看不见**
自己知识的不对称正在使自己处于不平衡的那一段，读书吧！

## Beauty

Virtue is fairer far than beauty of Beauty       
	By Francis Bacon

Virtue is like a rich stone,
best plain set; and surely virtue is best , in a body that is comedy, though not of delicate features;and that hath rather dignity of presence , than beauty of aspect.

Neither is it almost seen,that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue;as if nature were rather busy,not to err, than in labor to produce excellency.

And therefore they prove accomplished,but not of great spirit; and study rather behavior,than virtue.

But this holds not always:for Augustus Caesar,Titus Vespasianus,Philip le Belle of France,Edward the Fourth of England,Alcibiades of Athens,Ismael the Sophy of Persia, were all high and great spirits; and yet the most beautiful men of their times.

In beauty,that of favor,is more than that of color;and that of decent and gracious motion,more than that of favor.

That is the best part of beauty,which a picture cannot express;no,nor the first sight of the life.

There is no excellent beauty,that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.

A man cannot tell whether Apelles,or Albert Durer,were the more trifler;whereof the one,would make a persionage by geometrical proportions; the other,by taking the best parts out of divers faces, to make one excellent.

Such personage,I think ,would please nobody, but the painter that made them.

Not but I think a painter may make a better face than ever was;but he must do it by a kind of felicity(as a musician that maketh an excellent air in music), and not by rule.

A man shall see faces, that if you examine them part by part.

You shall find never a good;and yet altogether do well.If it be true that the principal part of beauty is in decent motion,certainly it is no marvel, thought persons in years seem many times more amiable; pulchrorum autumnus pulcher; for no youth can be comely but by pardon, and considering the youth,as to make up the comeliness.

Beauty is as summer fruits,which are easy to corrupt,and cannot last;and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth, and an age a little out of countenance; but yet certainly again,if it light well, it maketh virtue shine,and vices blush
