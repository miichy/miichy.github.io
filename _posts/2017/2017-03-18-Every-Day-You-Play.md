Every  Day You Play ...

Every day you play with the light of the universe.
Subtle vistor,you arrive in the flower and the water,
You are more than this white head that I hold tightly
as a bunch of flowers,every day,between my hands.

You are like nobody since I love you.
Let me spread you out among yellow garlands.
Who writes your name in letters of smoke among the stars of the south?
Oh let me remember you as you were before you existed.

Suddenly the wind howls and bangs at my shut window.
The sky is a net crammed with shadowy fish.
Here all the winds let go sooner or later, all of them.
The rain takes off her clothes.

The birds go by , fleeing.
The wind,The wind.
I alone can contend against the power of men.
The storm whirls dark leaves
and turns loose all the boats that were moored last night to the sky.

You are here.Oh,you do not run away.
You will answer me to the last cry.
Curl round me though you were frightened.
Even so, a strange shadow once ran through  your eyes.

Now,now too,little one,you bring me honeysuckle,
and even your breasts smell of it.
While the sad wind goes slaughtering butterflies
I love you, and my happiness bites the plum of your mouth.

How you must have suffered getting accustomed to me,
my savage,solitary soul,my name that sends them all running.
So many times we have seen the morning star burn,kissing our eyes,
and over our heads the grey light unwinds in turning fans.

My words rained over you,stroking you.
A long time I have loved the sunned mother-of-pearl of your body.
Until I even believe that you own the universe.
I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains,bluebells,dark hazels,and
rustic baskets of kisses.
I want to do with what spring does with the cherry trees.
